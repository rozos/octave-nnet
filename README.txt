PATCH INSTALLATION

This patch solves the issue* created after the drop of the function 'finite' (deprecated in version 4.0). It also implements the leakyrelu activation function. Having the Octave nnet package installed, do the following:

1. find where the nnet package is installed (search for the file newff.m),

2. copy all m files of the patch to the directory of nnet (overwrite the existing).
